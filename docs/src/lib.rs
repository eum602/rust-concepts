//! A pumpkin is a cultivar of winter squash that is round with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and is most often deep yellow
//! to orange in coloration. The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. The name is most commonly used for cultivars of
//! Cucurbita pepo, but some cultivars of Cucurbita maxima, C. argyrosperma, and C. moschata with similar appearance are also
//! sometimes called "pumpkins".
